<h2 id="getting_started">Getting started</h2>
<p>Skirmish is a game where you play as a Commander, trying to gain control of a rapidly shifting battlefield and force the enemy to retreat so you can control and stabilize the region. To do this, you will need to strategically deploy a variety of defensive structures and units, as well as lay traps for your enemy, in order to protect your headquarters and destroy theirs. You can watch the video below or read on to learn how to play!</p>
<p>Each player will have an HQ deck that represents the resources they have to maintain their efforts on the battlefield. When you run out of cards in your deck, retreat is the only option!</p>

<h2 id="what_you_need">What you need</h2>
<p>To play, you will need two players, at least a full playing deck’s worth of skirmish specific cards and/or regular playing cards in any combination (The full A-10 and J,K,Q of each suit), and something to use as counters to keep track of damage.</p>
<h4>You win by being the last player to run out of cards in their HQ deck.</h4>

<h2 id="building_your_hq_deck">Building your HQ deck</h2>
<p>There are two ways that I would recommend building an hq deck, dividing or drafting. If you are a newer player, or playing with a newer player, I would recommend dividing for the first few games.</p>
<h3>Divide</h3>
<p>If you are new to playing, separate the deck in half, with each player getting one red suit and one black suit.</p>
<h3>Draft</h3>
<p>Shuffle your 52 card playing deck. Then, place the top six cards face up. Each player takes a turn choosing from them until there are no cards remaining. Repeat this process, alternating who chooses first, until every card has been chosen.</p>
<h3>Choose your commander</h3><p>
Each player chooses one card they drafted to be their Commander. Then, each player may remove any other cards from their pool. The removed cards are put into that player’s command zone, and make up their reinforcement deck. The cards that weren’t removed will make up their HQ deck. Don't worry, the battlefield, or how your cards on the table are organized, is described later!</p>

<h2 id="how_to_play">How to play</h2>
<p>Each player shuffles their HQ deck, and draws 4 cards. Then, determine who will be attacking first. After that, each player reveals their chosen commander.</p>
<p>In Skirmish, players take a shared turn. Each turn is divided up into two phases, which in turn are divided into a series of steps. These phases, and steps, are outlined in greater detail under the <a href="#turn_phases"><strong>Turn Phases</strong></a> section of the rules.</p>

<h2 id="card_types">Card types</h2> 
<p>Each card has a type. If this is your first time playing, and you are using a playing card deck, I would recommend reading the <a href="#using_a_playing_card_deck">using a playing card deck</a> section to understand specifically what each card you will be playing with does.</p>

<h4>Structures</h4>
<p>When you deploy a structure, place it onto the battlefield in front of your HQ deck, your discard pile, or one of your two build zones. You may only have one structure deployed in front of, or protecting, a critical zone at any time.</p>
<p>Additionally:<br>
</p><ul>
<li>When a structure is dealt damage equal to or greater than it's health, it is destroyed.</li>
<li>A structure must be destroyed before attacking units can damage a critical zone it is in front of. While a structure is in front of a critical area zone, it is considered to be "protecting" that zone.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Units</h4>
<p>When deploying a unit, place it onto the battlefield in your patrol area. Units can be given orders on the same turn they are deployed.</p> 
<p>Units have 3 main traits:<br>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Health –</strong> A unit’s health determines how much damage they can take before they are destroyed.</li>
<li><strong>Power –</strong> A unit’s power determines how much damage they deal.</li>
<li><strong>Size –</strong> A unit’s size determines how fast it can act in combat. The smaller the number, the better.</li>
</ul>
<p>Damage dealt to units doesn’t go away when turns end. It stays there until the game ends or the unit is destroyed. If a unit has damage equal to or greater than its health, it is destroyed.</p>

<h4>Tactics</h4>
<p>When you deploy a tactic card, you simply do what it's rules text says, then put it into the discard pile.</p>

<h4>Copies</h4>
<p>Copy cards are always treated as copies of the card you choose to be your commander.</p>

<h4>Officers</h4>
<p>Officer cards are deployed to the battlefield, and always provide an ability that benefits you.</p> 
<p>Units attacking you can target and damage officer cards whenever you don't have defending units. Damage dealt to officers is permanent, and when an officer card has damage equal to or greater than their health, they are retired. An officer that is retired is put into your discard pile.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>If an officer is your commander card, it cannot be dealt damage or targeted. If it is retired, it is simply turned face down.</em></p>

<h4>Attachments</h4>
<p>Attachment cards are attached to another card of a specific type when they are deployed, and add or modify traits of that card. If the card it is attached to leaves the battlefield, any cards attached to it are put in their owners discard pile.</p>

<h4>Special type: ambush</h4>
<p>In addition to their other types, some cards may also be ambush cards. When a card has ambush, it means that it is much more flexible in how you can use it!</p>
<p>First, you can deploy an ambush card normally, like any other card. If you do, simply ignore the trigger and effect parts of the card.</p>
<p>Also, </p>
<p>Lastly, if an ambush card in your hand has the trigger condition met, you can choose to discard it. If you do, you will get to do the Ambush effect of the card, but you'll have to ignore the rules text that it has.</p>

<h2 id="commanders">Commanders</h2>
<p>The commander card in your command zone is used to track when you are attacking or defending. When you are attacking, your commander card is vertical in your command zone. It is sideways when you are defending.</p><p> Additionally, all copy cards in your HQ deck are copies of the card you choose to be your commander.</p> 
<p>When choosing a card to be your commander card, think of it as your preferred unit or style of play. Maybe you like to lay traps, so your commander card is a classic trap card, or maybe you like brute force and you have a big beefy unit. Maybe you like to always be able to scout and so your commander is a small unit that can stealthily work it's way through your enemy forces.</p>

<h2 id="the_battlefield">The Battlefield</h2>
<p>The battlefield is divided up into 3 parts. The patrol zone, command zone, and critical area zones. Here is a rough idea of how to organize your play area, and each zone is described below.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/peVkrMl.png" style="width:100%;max-width:610px;"></p>

<h3>Command zone</h3>
 <p>This is a space off to the side where you place your Commander and reinforcement deck.</p>

<h3>Critical area zones</h3>
 <h4>Deck zone</h4>
<p>This is where you place your HQ deck. It also represents how many resources you have left to spend before you are forced to retreat from the skirmish (a.k.a. lose). <em>When your deck is dealt damage, put that many cards from the top of it into your discard pile.</em></p>
 <h4>Discard pile zone</h4>
<p>This is where destroyed and discarded cards go. <em>When a discard pile is dealt damage, all cards in it are put into its owner’s reinforcement deck. Then, at the end of the combat phase, its owner puts that many cards from the top of their HQ deck into their discard pile.</em></p>
 <h4>Build zones</h4>
<p>You have 2 build zones that you can put a card in face down. <em>When a card in a build zone is dealt damage, it is returned to its owner’s hand.</em></p>

<h3>Patrol zone</h3>
 <p>This is where you keep track of your permanents that aren't structures.</p>

<h2 id="turn_phases">Turn phases</h2>
<p>Players take a shared turn. The attacking player has priority. This means that in speed ties, their units always deal damage first, and they their actions during each step last.</p>

<ol>
<h3>Main phase</h3>
<p>Each player takes the following steps in order. The defending player always does their step first.</p>

<li><strong>Draw step –</strong> Draw a card.</li>
<li><strong>Untap step –</strong> If you are the attacking player, untap any tapped units.</li>
<li><strong>Deploy step –</strong> You may deploy one card from your hand, and any number of cards from your build zones. <em>On the first turn, the attacking player may deploy <strong>one additional</strong> card from their hand</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Build step –</strong> The defending player may place cards from their hand into any number of empty build zones.</li>

<h3>Orders phase</h3>
<p>Attacking players may scout and issue attack orders, then defending players issue defend orders, and then combat ensues.</p>

 <li><strong>Scout orders step –</strong> If you are the attacking player, you may tap a unit. If you do, each player that doesn't have a unit of <strong>equal or smaller size</strong> reveals all cards in their build zones and destroys any traps that aren't protected by a structure.</li>
 <li><strong>Attack orders step –</strong> If you are the attacking player, declare which untapped units you control are being given attack orders.</li>
 <li><strong>Defend orders step –</strong> If you are a defending player, choose any number of untapped units they control to defend against attacking units with.</li>
 <li><strong>Combat step –</strong> Each unit will take a turn choosing a combat action. The smallest unit takes their turn first, and the largest unit takes their turn last.<br>

<strong>The following are combat actions:</strong>
<ul>
<li>A unit may deal equal to their power to another unit of your choice. If there are no defending units, that unit may deal its damage to any card or zone the defending player controls instead.</li>
<li>Any combat action defined in that unit’s deploy text.</li>
</ul>

If a unit is destroyed before it gets to take its turn, it does not get to take its turn.</li>


<li><strong>Cleanup step –</strong> All "until end of turn" effects wear off. Each player changes their commander’s stance.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="using_a_playing_card_deck">Using a playing card deck</h2>
<p>You can use a standard playing card deck to play Skirmish. <em>It is highly recommended  that if a player is not familiar with the cards, you write as much relevant information on as many cards as possible to help reduce the number of things that player will need to remember</em>. This list also makes up the first set of skirmish. Regular Playing cards are always the following card types with the following traits, even if they are mixed and matched with other skirmish cards:</p>

<h3>Unit cards</h3>
<p><strong>All cards numbered 2-6</strong> are unit cards. They have power and size equal to their number, and health equal to twice their number.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;width:100%;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/OlaEkQS.png" style="max-width:300px; width:100%;"></p>

<h3>Structure cards</h3>
<p><strong>All cards numbered 7-10</strong> are structure cards with rules text that says “Discard this card: Draw a card.”</p>
<p>This means that while this card is in your hand, you may discard it at any time to draw another card.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;width:100%;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/vw4V7nW.png" style="max-width:300px; width:100%;"></p>

<h3>Copy cards</h3>
<p><strong>The four Aces</strong> are copy cards.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;width:100%;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/jDMvuoQ.png" style="max-width:300px; width:100%;"></p>

<h3>Ambush Tactic cards</h3>
<p>Face Cards are tactics cards with ambush.</p>
<p><strong>Red face cards</strong> have <strong>rules text that says "Draw up to two cards."</strong> They also trigger whenever "A unit is attacking you." When triggered, these cards have an <em>Ambush Effect</em> of "Target player puts an attacking unit they control into one of their empty build zones, if able.”</p>
<p><strong>Black face cards</strong> have rules text that says "Destroy target permanent." They also trigger whenever "a unit is attacking you", just like the red ones and have the ambush effect of "Draw a card."</p>
<p style="text-align:center;width:100%;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/s8AAjxA.png" style="max-width:300px; width:100%;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/qwInWOV.png" style="max-width:300px; width:100%;"></p>

<h3>New Cards</h3>
<p>If you enjoy playing skirmish you can find new cards to play with here! There are print to play options, as well as the option to order developer support booster packs and full sets to help support everyone who is working on developing more exciting cards to play with!</p>
<p>Just remember, whenever you are building a deck, it must be a functioning playing card deck. This means that you must have 52 total cards in your pool, and it cannot have 2 Aces of Hearts, for example, even if they are different cards in every other aspect.</p>
<p>Also, feel free to experiment with designs of your own! If you have been playing with a unique card that you and your friends are enjoying, please send it to me and I’ll consider adding it to a future set, with accreditation!</p>


<h3>Different ways to play</h3>
<h4>Drafting with more than 2 players</h4>
<p>You will need 52 cards for each player. Shuffle all of the cards together and use them to create three 18 card piles for each player.</p>
<p>If you would like, each player can instead bring 18 card developer support packs that can be purchased here.</p>
<p>Each player takes their first pile, picks a card from it, and then passes the rest of the cards in a clockwise fashion to the next player. Repeat this process with the pile of cards handed to you until all cards have been picked.</p>
<p>Do it again for the next pile of 18 cards, passing in a counter clockwise direction.</p>
<p>Do it a final time for the last pile of 18 cards, passing in a clockwise direction.</p>
<p>Each player uses their picked cards to build 40 card HQ deck, a reinforcement deck, and chooses their commander.</p> 
<p>Play best of three 1v1 matches to see who wins the most games.</p>
<h4>Pre-constructed Decks</h4>
<p>You can also play skirmish with pre-constructed decks, where each player brings their own customized deck to play against each other. </p>
<p>It is recommended that:
</p><ul>
<li>HQ decks are no more than 40 cards in size.</li>
<li>Each customized deck should be a complete playing card deck. (Do not have 2 Ace of hearts, for example, even if each ace of hearts does or is something different).</li>
</ul>
